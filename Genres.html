        <h3>Genres Explained</h3>
        <p>
            Music can be separated into multiple different types of music. 
            This can be simplified down what is known as a music genre.
            There are many different types of music genres out there and we 
            each are attracted to, who knows, maybe one or many genres! 
            So instead of just classifying music as one whole concept, we 
            can simplify searches and interests based on the genre of music a user 
            listens to!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here are the top 3 big music genres right now:
            <ul>
                <li>Hip Hop</li>
                <li>Country</li>
                <li>Rock 'n' Roll</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Those are only the top 3 big name genres right now, however, 
            there are many more not mentioned. Some that are worthy to be 
            noted are electro, funk, jazz (big in the 60s and 70s), pop, 
            and reggae. Feel free to google music genres to find a WHOLE LOT MORE!
